# ChangeCalculator
Class exercise

In this exercise, I developed a form that tells how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies are needed to make
change for any amount of change from 0 through 99 cents. One way to get the results is to use the division and 
modulus operators and to cast the results of each division to an integer.
